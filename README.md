Woodpecker CI plugin to build multiarch Docker images with [buildx](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=docker+buildx&ia=web).
This plugin was initially a fork of [thegeeklab/drone-docker-buildx](https://github.com/thegeeklab/drone-docker-buildx/) (now archived in favor of this plugin) which itself was a fork of [drone-plugins/drone-docker](https://github.com/drone-plugins/drone-docker).
You can find the full documentation at [woodpecker-ci.org](https://woodpecker-ci.org/plugins/Docker%20Buildx) ([docs.md](./docs.md)).
